 The Center for Global Data Visualization - Economics Impact of COVID-19


### Data
1. Risk factor
COVID-19-related disruptions to the model may arise through different components of the shock: 

Ability to pay: economic disruptions may mean that customers with particular vulnerabilities (e.g., employed by small business) who previously could afford products no longer can

Willingness to pay: this could see either positive or negative impacts; higher demand for electricity due increased time at home, but tighter overall margins might mean other items (e.g., food and healthcare) take priority

Payment terms: flexibility introduced by companies may alter clientsâ€™ repayment behavior

Government action: mandated payment holidays, relief funds and government subsidies to households, the exemption of off-grid solar as an essential service, etc. further influence company and customer behavior 

Data from Fraym can help reveal which households might be most vulnerable by identifying characteristics that are correlated with either spreading or succumbing to COVID-19, which Nithio uses to update its models. While early changes to the model are based on assumptions about what will happen next, we are continually updating them as new information becomes available.
